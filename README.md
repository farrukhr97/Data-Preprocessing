Data Preprocessing on Data.csv
Overview
This repository contains a dataset that has undergone various data preprocessing techniques to ensure data quality, consistency, and readiness for machine learning and analytics. Preprocessing is a crucial step in data science, transforming raw data into a clean and structured format.

Dataset Features
Raw Data: The original dataset before preprocessing.
Processed Data: The cleaned and transformed dataset after applying preprocessing techniques.
Preprocessing Techniques Applied
✔ Handling Missing Values – Imputation (mean, median, mode) and removal of missing entries.
✔ Data Cleaning – Removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting data.
✔ Feature Scaling – Normalization and standardization for better model performance.
✔ Encoding Categorical Variables – One-hot encoding and label encoding for categorical data.
✔ Outlier Detection & Treatment – Identifying and handling outliers using statistical methods.
✔ Feature Engineering – Creating new relevant features to improve predictive power.

Usage
This dataset and preprocessing pipeline can be useful for:
✅ Machine learning model training
✅ Data exploration and visualization
✅ Benchmarking preprocessing techniques
✅ Feature engineering and selection experiments
